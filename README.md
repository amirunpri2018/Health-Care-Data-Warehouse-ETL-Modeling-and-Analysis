# Objective -

The main purpose of this project is to create a dynamic data warehouse consisting of information on health care services, providers, suppliers & its beneficiaries. In this project we programmed ETL workflows using SSIS to stage Healthcare Data from multiple sources & to transform & load it into dimension & facts at the destination Enterprise Data warehouse (SQL Server). The objective of the warehouse was evaluating Medicare provider or supplier efficiency & also to identify the most optimal medical centers or states for respective healthcare needs of its beneficiaries with the help of SSAS OLAP cubes & Tableau dashboards.
